# Changelog

## v0.43.0 (2026-09-21)

- Route the *selected* USB pair to MIX/REC OUT on models without a readable route register
  (DJM-V10, DJM-S11, DJM-450 unchanged): picking USB 5/6 on a V10 now records MIX on USB 5/6.
- Correct Pioneer route source tables against the Linux `snd-usb-audio` DJM quirks: 0x0a is
  REC OUT (with mic), 0x0e REC OUT without mic, 0x09 mic-only (never a MIX route). DJM-750MK2 no
  longer writes 0x0f ("None") and defaults to its factory REC OUT pair USB 9/10.
- Add **Include microphone** (A9, V5), **Mixer USB recording level** (A9, V10; vendor register
  0x8003, +15 dB … 0 dB) and a **Sample rate** picker to Recording setup. Software gain now
  defaults to 0 dB instead of +12 dB.
- Generic AlphaTheta fallback: an unknown or vendor-class-only mixer (e.g. a DJM-V5 with a
  different product ID) is captured with the shared 12-ch/24-bit template and clearly marked
  unverified instead of being refused. Any AlphaTheta device now launches the app on attach.
- Add **Diagnostics > Copy USB descriptors** for finishing mixer profiles from real hardware.
- Add a per-mixer **Mixer profile** override in Recording setup: force any built-in profile
  (e.g. treat an unrecognised mixer as a DJM-V5 or DJM-A9), choose "class-compliant only" to
  send no vendor commands, or hand-enter the USB wire format (channel count, sample container,
  capture endpoint) and toggle the silent playback keepalive and endpoint sample-rate command.
  Stored per mixer, applied by re-reading the device, no rebuild needed.
- DJM-V5: product IDs 0x0058-0x005B, the REC OUT with/without mic options and the six-step USB
  recording level are now confirmed against AlphaTheta's DJM-V5 Setting Utility 1.0.0; the
  mixer USB level control is offered for the V5 as well.
- Native capture: never issue vendor control transfers from the libusb event thread (the
  "route all pairs" fallback is handed to the app's USB connection); inspect transfer status so an
  unplugged mixer or a dead endpoint ends the session within one health tick; raise the capture
  thread to audio priority; decimate per-channel activity decoding; fix a data race in the
  playback keepalive pacing and a use-after-free window when stats/live PCM were read during
  close; claim a shared capture/playback interface once.
- Service: health, meter and notification polling survive transient states; the wake lock's
  timeout is renewed every tick; a refused foreground promotion after the encoder started no
  longer leaves an orphaned MediaStore row; dropped start Intents release their USB connection;
  free-space failures are treated as unknown rather than unlimited.
- Add a one-tap battery-optimization exemption in Settings (`REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS`).
- Remove the dead "Android audio stack" and "DJM-REC port" experiments (the MULTI I/O port is a
  USB host port for iPhone/iPad and cannot work with Android).
- Build: pin libusb to v1.0.29, replace deprecated `FetchContent_Populate`, and build/run the
  native unit tests in CI via CMake/ctest.

## v0.42.3 (2026-09-16)

- Correct DJM-450 MIX/REC OUT routing to honor the selected USB pair after interface and
  sample-rate initialization, without requiring unsupported route readback.
- Enable silent eight-channel playback keepalive for DJM-450 USB capture. Physical mixer
  validation is still required; the profile remains experimental.
- Report DJM-450 setup-command results and retain native startup failures in Firebase
  diagnostics. Restarting capture on the same connection now produces fresh health snapshots.
- Add regression coverage for selected-pair routing, duplex configuration and setup telemetry.
- Fix CI and release SDK setup by skipping the unavailable legacy `tools` package.

## v0.42.2 (2026-09-14)

- Add privacy-controlled Firebase Analytics events for non-crash app, mixer connection,
  recording, streaming and recovery diagnostics.
- Report mixer identity, selected USB format and channel pair, transfer health, active USB
  channels and playback keepalive state to diagnose unsupported or silent mixer captures.
- Keep telemetry disabled until the existing Automatic diagnostics setting is enabled, and
  exclude audio, filenames, credentials, serial numbers and raw USB descriptors.

## v0.42.1 (2026-09-09)

- Remove Pro DJ Link discovery, automatic metadata markers and now-playing banners from
  the main app. These features and USB protocol research belong exclusively to the
  `experimental` branch and its separate application package.
- Retain the USB capture cleanup and removal of obsolete root/ALSA paths.
- Provision the missing repository Firebase configuration required by signed release builds.
  The v0.42.0 release build failed before producing release APKs.

## v0.42.0 (2026-09-09)

- Add opt-in Ethernet Pro DJ Link discovery and track metadata for CDJ-2000NXS2 players,
  with a shared application API for deck status and now-playing information.
- Align automatic track markers with recorded audio and add customizable top/bottom
  now-playing banners to camera and artwork livestreams.
- Add network selection and USB descriptor checks. DJM-A9 computer USB-B track metadata
  remains unverified; this integration uses a separate Ethernet connection.
- Remove obsolete root/ALSA capture paths and their settings, retaining the Android USB
  capture pipeline and diagnostics.
- USB protocol probes and raw packet research tools remain in the separate experimental
  branch and app build. Live mixer/player validation is still required.

## v0.41.3 (2026-09-08)

- Show the installed app version in Settings and add a manual update check with clear current,
  available, download, and error states.
- Download the latest signed release APK from GitHub, verify its published SHA-256 checksum and
  package identity, then open Android's installer for user confirmation.

## v0.41.2 (2026-09-08)

- Fix stretched, square-looking portrait livestreams by keeping RootEncoder's video preparation
  as the single owner of encoder dimensions and camera rotation. Portrait output is now 720x1280.
- Let YouTube automatically detect ingest resolution and frame rate so 9:16 streams are recognized
  as vertical instead of being constrained by a fixed 720p landscape declaration.

## v0.41.1 (2026-09-08)

- Improve livestream setup UI with visible broadcast title input, clearer selected options,
  simpler YouTube setup, and automatic USB mixer arming from the Go live flow.
- Lock portrait livestream output to the selected orientation instead of allowing sensor
  auto-rotation to produce landscape frames with side bars.
- Rescan USB audio on Activity resume and from the input picker so detection and monitoring
  no longer depend on opening the Mixer USB section first.

## v0.41.0 (2026-09-08)

- Cap waveform drawing at 60 fps, reduce snapshots to about 30 Hz, and stop native
  waveform analysis/polling while hidden. Background meters update once per second;
  recording, USB keepalive, streaming, and safety checks remain active.
- Resolve USB rates from packet cadence instead of short wall-clock estimates. Never
  use uncertain measurements such as 99,271 Hz as a recording/encoder format.
- Convert high-rate mixer PCM to 44.1/48 kHz for streaming with anti-alias filtering.
  Report separate audio and camera preparation errors and lower artwork video to 15 fps.
- Replace the streaming form with Connect, Picture, and Go live steps, a fixed action
  button, mixer meters, and retryable memory-only credentials. Preserve planned YouTube
  broadcasts after pre-live failures and start authorization lifecycle from current state.
- Report silent selected channels accurately even when USB packets contain low-level noise.
- Real broadcast playback and measured battery savings still require device validation.

## v0.40.2 (2026-09-08)

- Stop repeating healthy Bugfender capture reports. Log connection/health changes,
  one settled snapshot, and initial payload/signal detection; retain fault reporting.
- Replace waveform morphing with cursor-based scrolling on the display frame clock.
  Preserve historical peaks, protect concurrent snapshots, and keep live history when
  recording starts. Waveform updates no longer recompose the full recording page.
- Use additive RGB shading: red bass, green mids, blue highs; mixed bands produce
  yellow, cyan, magenta, and white. Remove the flickering white waveform outline.
- Open active camera streams in a full recording workspace with local stereo meters,
  gain, stream/record timers, camera switching, framing guides, and confirmed stop.
  These controls and overlays are not included in the video sent to viewers.
- Give queued livestream PCM frames their own buffers and sample-based timestamps.
  Detect stalled PCM and outgoing AAC/H.264, clean up unexpected disconnections,
  and preserve the stream timer across reconnects.
- Add regression coverage for quiet diagnostics, RGB colors, waveform timing and
  concurrent history, PCM timestamps, and stalled media delivery.
- Device rendering performance and end-to-end camera broadcasts still need physical
  validation; livestreaming remains experimental.

## v0.40.1 (2026-09-08)

- Add detailed Bugfender mixer connection reports: detected model, USB IDs, selected
  profile, transport, routing defaults, interfaces, and endpoints.
- Report advertised channel counts, PCM formats, sample rates in kHz, and clock
  capabilities; distinguish profile defaults from descriptor and runtime evidence.
- Measure raw input activity per channel before gain and stereo selection, with
  approximate one-second peak windows, dBFS levels, and snapshot age.
- Correlate connection, permission, capture, and failure logs using a connection ID
  and code locations, including unknown devices to help diagnose future support.
- Bound recurring health/error reports and retain the existing diagnostics opt-out.
- Add channel-activity and diagnostic-report regression tests and contributor guidance.
- Generate GitHub release notes directly from this changelog.

## v0.40.0 (2026-09-08)

- Redesign the recording workspace with accessible input/setup controls, stereo
  meters, smoother three-band waveforms, and a layout for wider screens.
- Improve automatic arming, USB format selection, per-mixer channel preferences,
  recording saves/recovery, and the notification's Save & close action.
- Improve recorded-set search, playback, seeking, sharing, export, rename/delete,
  and track markers within stereo recordings.
- Add customization settings and improve experimental livestreaming and YouTube
  authorization/broadcast handling.
- Expand mixer profiles and all-in-one recognition with descriptor-based capture
  where supported. DJM-A9 and DJM-750MK2 remain the hardware-confirmed devices;
  other profiles require physical testing. Recognition alone does not confirm capture.
- Add automatic Bugfender diagnostics for debug and release builds, crash reporting,
  release mapping uploads, and an in-app opt-out. Audio payloads are not uploaded.
- Simplify the README with supported-device status and recording guidance.

## v0.36.6 (2026-08-22)

- Correct the input-meter scale so every dB label aligns with the measured peak position
- Add the installed DJM-S11 Windows driver-derived VID/PID profile (`2B73:0037`)
- Add the S11 vendor-class 14-channel playback / 10-channel capture contract and playback
  keepalive required by its clocking
- Route S11 MIX/REC OUT to USB 5/6 with the validated Pioneer vendor request

## v0.36.5 (2026-08-14)

- Update the live waveform independently at 50 fps for smoother visual response
- Keep meter, health, and notification polling on their existing schedules
- Stop waveform polling automatically when monitoring/recording ends

## v0.36.4 (2026-08-14)

- Add driver-derived DJM-V10 and DJM-450 capture profiles and Windows driver archives
- Keep DJM-A9 recording hardware-validated; mark other mixer profiles for physical testing
- Name normal recordings `mix_YYYYMMDD_HHmmss` without a misleading part suffix
- Retain part suffixes only for genuine WAV rollover files
