/**
 * CDJ-3000-style RGB waveform analyzer.
 *
 * Rather than an expensive full FFT, this uses three 2nd-order IIR filters
 * (low-pass ~250Hz, band-pass ~250–2000Hz, high-pass ~2000Hz) — a lightweight visualization filter bank — to split the left and right signals independently
 * into three frequency bands. Band energies are accumulated into fixed-width
 * display bins (~6ms each at 48kHz), producing a rolling 512-bin waveform
 * where each bin carries [amplitude, lowEnergy, midEnergy, highEnergy].
 *
 * Thread safety: pushFrames() is called from the realtime audio callback
 * (must not allocate/block); getBins() is called from the UI polling thread.
 * Individual bin values are atomic, so UI reads never block audio writes.
 * The reader snapshots a published cursor; an extra 512 slots protect its history
 * from concurrent writes. A bounded retry rejects a reader stalled for a full history.
