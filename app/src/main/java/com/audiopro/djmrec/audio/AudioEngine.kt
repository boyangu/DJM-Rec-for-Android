    /**
     * Opens the raw libusb isochronous capture path instead of AAudio/AudioRecord, extracting
     * a stereo pair out of a wider multichannel USB Audio interface. This exists because
     * AAudio has no API to select an arbitrary channel *offset* out of a multichannel UAC2
     * interface -- it only ever gives you channels 1/2 (or all N channels, undifferentiated).
     * Mixers like the Pioneer DJM-A9 expose a combined 12-channel interface. This path can
     * select any stereo pair and, for the DJM-A9, routes MIX (REC OUT) to that pair first.
     *
     * @param fd an *open* `UsbDeviceConnection.getFileDescriptor()` -- the connection must be
     *   kept open (not `.close()`'d) for the entire capture session; see
     *   `UsbAudioManager.openIsoCaptureHandle()`.
     * @param interfaceNumber the AudioStreaming interface number (not AudioControl).
     * @param alternateSetting the alt setting whose isochronous endpoint carries audio (UAC2
     *   devices idle on alt setting 0, which has no endpoint / zero bandwidth).
     * @param endpointAddress the isochronous IN endpoint address (e.g. `0x81`).
     * @param maxPacketSize `wMaxPacketSize` from that endpoint's descriptor.
     * @param totalChannels total interleaved channel count in the *wire* format (e.g. 12).
     * @param subframeSize bytes per sample container on the wire (1/2/3/4).
     * @param bitResolution significant bits per sample within that container (e.g. 24).
     * @param extractChannelOffset 0-indexed first channel of the stereo pair to pull out.
     * @param sampleRateHint trusted as-is; nothing in this path negotiates a rate back from
     *   the device the way AAudio does.
     * @param includeMicInMix route REC OUT *with* the mic bus (vendor source 0x0a) instead of
     *   "REC OUT without mic" (0x0e) on Pioneer models that offer both.
     * @param playbackOverride -1 follow the profile, 0 force the silent OUT keepalive off, 1 on.
     * @param endpointRateOverride -1 follow the profile, 0/1 force the UAC1 SET_CUR rate command.
     * @param allowFormatMismatch true when the wire format was entered manually (profile table
     *   mismatches are logged, not fatal).
     * @return `sampleRateHint` on success, or -1 on failure.
